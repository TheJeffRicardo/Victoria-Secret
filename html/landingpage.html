                            Victoria's Secret is an American lingerie, clothing, and beauty
                            retailer known for high visibility marketing and branding,
                            starting with a popular catalog and followed by an annual fashion
                            show with supermodels dubbed Angels. As the largest retailer of
                            lingerie in the United States, the brand has struggled since 2016
                            due to shifting consumer preferences and ongoing controversy
                            surrounding corporate leadership's business practices. Founded in
                            1977 by Roy and Gaye Raymond, the company's five lingerie stores
                            were sold to Leslie Wexner in 1982.Wexner rapidly expanded into
                            American shopping malls, growing the company into 350 stores
                            nationally with sales of $1 billion by the early 1990s when
                            Victoria's Secret became the largest lingerie retailer in the
                            United States. From 1995 through 2018, the Victoria's Secret
                            Fashion Show was an essential part of the brand's image featuring
                            an annual runway spectacle of models promoted by the company as
                            fantasy Angels.The 1990s saw the company's further expansion
                            throughout shopping malls along with the introduction of the
                            'miracle bra', the new brand Body by Victoria, and the development
                            of a line of fragrances and cosmetics. In 2002 Victoria's Secret
                            announced the launch of PINK, a brand that was aimed to appeal to
                            teenagers.Starting in 2008, Victoria's Secret expanded
                            internationally, with retail outlets within international
                            airports, franchises in major cities overseas, and in
                            company-owned stores throughout Canada and the UK. By 2016,
                            Victoria's Secret's market share began to decline due to
                            competition from other brands that embraced a wider range of sizes
                            and a growing consumer preference for athleisure.The company
                            canceled the circulation of their famous catalog in 2016. The
                            brand struggled to maintain its market position following ongoing
                            criticism and controversy over the unsavory behavior and business
                            practices of corporate leadership under Wexner and Ed Razek.As of
                            May 2020, with over 1,070 stores, Victoria's Secret remained the
                            largest lingerie retailer in the United States.
